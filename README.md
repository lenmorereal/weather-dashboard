# Weather Dashboard Project Proposal

## 1. Project Idea
**Chosen Project:** Weather Dashboard

**Reason for Choice:**
I chose the Weather Dashboard project because I am fascinated by how weather impacts daily life and the challenge of displaying dynamic data in a user-friendly manner. This project will allow me to explore API integration and responsive design while providing real-time weather updates to users.

## 2. API Selection
**API Chosen:** OpenWeatherMap API

**API Features:**
- **Current Weather Data:** Provides real-time weather information based on location.
- **5-Day Weather Forecast:** Offers a forecast for the next five days with data available every three hours.
- **Weather Alerts:** Notifies users of severe weather conditions.
- **Geocoding API:** Converts city names into geographical coordinates.

## 3. Project Timeline
**Week 1:**
- Research weather APIs and finalize the API choice.
- Set up the project environment with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Design wireframes and user interface mockups.

**Week 2:**
- Implement core functionalities: fetch and display current weather.
- Set up API calls to retrieve weather data.
- Test API integration and error handling.

**Week 3:**
- Add 5-day forecast feature.
- Implement geolocation and search functionality.
- Enhance UI with responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

**Week 4:**
- Conduct final testing and debugging.
- Deploy the Weather Dashboard to a hosting platform.
- Prepare documentation and a project report.

**Week 5:**
- Submit the project for evaluation.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
